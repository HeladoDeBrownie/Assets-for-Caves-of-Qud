# How to use these assets

The tiles (sprites) in this repository are represented in the way most suited for inclusion without modification in a *Caves of Qud* mod. In order to properly view them, you need a program that distinguishes black, white, and fully transparent. (Some image viewers may not distinguish either black or white from transparent.) You may wish to render them in the game itself, which can also add color to them. See [the Official Caves of Qud Wiki's article on Tiles Modding](https://cavesofqud.gamepedia.com/Modding:Tiles) for more information.
